[PCRaster](https://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/) is a collection of software targeted at the development and deployment of spatio-temporal environmental models.Some of the characteristics of PCRaster include:

  * Executes models very fast.
  * Contains a scripting model development environment: it allows users to develop their own simulation models. 
  * Scripting languages supported include PCRcalc and Python
  * Is mainly applied in environmental modelling: geography, hydrology, ecology to name a few. But also other models can be constructed. Examples include rainfall-runoff models, vegetation competition models and slope stability models.
  * Includes a rich set of model building blocks and analytical functions for manipulating raster GIS maps.
  * Includes a framework for construction of stochastic spatio-temporal models and data assimilation.
  * Comes with a tool for interactive visualisation of spatio-temporal stochastic data.
  * Runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, is open source software (GPLv3, as of PCRaster version 4) and can be downloaded for free!
