## Python GUI Enabled App that Reports the Current Weather Conditions of Any City in the World

#### Abstract

- This simple but powerful app asks the user to click a `GUI button` then click another `RUN` button then it displays the current weather conditions of the city.
- Good to note, the [openweathermap API](openweathermap.org) supports a time-delay of `10 mins` before they can refresh their servers to update the user of the weather data requessted for.
##### Requirements
The following are the basic requirements to fully achieve the aim of this project
- You'll first of all need to [sign up](openweathermap.org) for a free account with [Openweathermap](openweathermap.org) to get a FREE  API to request for the near-real time weather data.
- This should take less than 2 hours to receive your API
- Once in the main project directory, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.This will enable your python `pip/pip3` to read through the `requirements.txt` file in this folder and installs the python libraries needed for this project.
- Then, go to the `url = "https://api.openweathermap...` line and paste your API key there towards the end of that line as indicated, just before `.format()`.
- Once it is through without any errors, run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` depending on the python versin you're using.
- upon running the code, you'll see an image like the one labelled `selectCity.png`

    * Will fix the image bug later
  <!-- <img src=“outputs/selectCity.png” alt=“SelectCity.png” /> -->

- Click the `select the city` button, from the drop down , you'll see cities to view their weather and click `RUN` button.
- You'll see and image like the one labeled `results.png`

#### Errata.
